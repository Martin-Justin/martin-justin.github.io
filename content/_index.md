## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I'm a PhD student at the University of Maribor, Slovenia. 
My research interests are in philosophy of science and epistemology. 
Currently, Iâ€™m working on higher-order evidence and using computer simulations to study science. Additionally, I act as an editorial assistant at the journal Acta Analytica (Springer).
Here, you can find my [CV](/resume.pdf). I also have [academia.edu](https://uni-aas.academia.edu/MartinJustin) and [PhilPeople](https://philpeople.org/profiles/martin-justin) pages, and a profile on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/martinjustin.bsky.social).

I also work as a freelance writer and editor. Currently, I'm the editor-in-chief at ludliteratura.si. In 2023, I served as a coordinator of the Slovenian Literary Critics' Association.
A list of my published texts, most of them in Slovene, can be found [here](/writing).
