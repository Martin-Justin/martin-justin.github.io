## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I'm a master's student of philosophy at University of Ljubljana. 
My research interests are in philosophy of science and applied philosophy. 
Currently, Iâ€™m working on my thesis on epistemic disagreement in scientific communities. 
Here, you can find my [CV](/resume.pdf). I also have [academia.edu](https://uni-aas.academia.edu/MartinJustin) and [PhilPeople](https://philpeople.org/profiles/martin-justin) pages.

I also work as a freelance writer and critic. Currently, I act as a coordinator of the Slovenian Literary Critics' Association.
A list of my published texts, most of them in Slovene, can be found [here](/writing). 

Feel free to contact me.
